## 📋 QUICK NAVIGATION

| Team | Focus | For You If... | Read This |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| 🛡️ **BLUE TEAM** | Defense | You love defending! Like blocking attacks in rugby! | [BLUE_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md](./BLUE_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md) |
| ⚔️ **RED TEAM** | Offense | Need to understand attackers (even if you hate tool grinding!) | [RED_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md](./RED_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md) |
| 💜 **PURPLE TEAM** | Both | Want to bridge offense & defense (BEST career path!) | [PURPLE_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md](./PURPLE_TEAM_TOOLKIT.md) |

## 🎯 PHILOSOPHY

### **Why All Three?**

> "To defend effectively, you must understand offense. To attack effectively, you must understand defense. To excel at security, you must master BOTH."

**The Reality:**
- You can **specialize** in one team (Blue for David!)
- But you should **understand** all three
- Knowledge is power - even if you don't use it daily

### **David's Approach:**
```
Primary: 🛡️ BLUE TEAM (80%)
- This is where my passion is
- Defense, incident response, system hardening
- Sit back until shit happens, then FIX IT!

Understanding: ⚔️ RED TEAM (15%)
- Know how attackers think
- Understand exploits conceptually
- Watch YouTube, pass NCI course, move on

Future: 💜 PURPLE TEAM (5% now, 50% later?)
- Bridge knowledge of both
- Focus on improving detection
- High-paying career path
```
