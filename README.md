## Quick Install (One-Liner)

### Step 1. Install Everything

> The install scripts auto-detect your OS, install Node.js 22 + npm + dependencies, and guide you through API key setup. Smart enough to use `brew` on macOS, `winget` on Windows, or `apt`/`dnf`/`pacman`/`apk`/`zypper` on Linux.

**Windows (PowerShell - Run as Admin):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidtkeane/rangerplex-ai/main/install-me-now.ps1 | iex
```

**macOS (Terminal):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidtkeane/rangerplex-ai/main/install-me-now.sh | bash
```

**Linux / WSL (Terminal):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidtkeane/rangerplex-ai/main/install-me-now.sh | bash
```

**Already cloned? Run locally:**
```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL:
bash install-me-now.sh

# Windows:
.\install-me-now.ps1
```

> The installer will offer to start RangerPlex for you at the end via PM2. If you skip that, use Step 2 below.

### Step 2. Start RangerPlex (after install)

```bash
# Recommended - runs in background via PM2 (all platforms):
npm run pm2:start

# Or run in foreground (dev mode):
npm run dev
```

**Useful PM2 commands:**
```bash
npm run pm2:status   # Check server status
npm run pm2:logs     # View real-time logs
npm run pm2:stop     # Stop all servers
npm run pm2:restart  # Restart servers
```

> **Note:** You do NOT need to run `npm run build` first. The installer handles everything and the dev server runs directly. Build is only needed if you want to create a production bundle.

### 🖼️ Understanding Image Features (IMPORTANT!)

RangerPlex has **TWO different image features** that work in completely different ways:

#### 1️⃣ Image GENERATION (Creating Images)
**Purpose**: Generate NEW images from text descriptions

**How to use**:
- Type `/imagine` followed by your description
- Example: `/imagine a futuristic city at sunset`
- Uses: **DALL-E 3, Imagen 3, or Flux.1** (dedicated image generators)
- **Note**: Your selected model (Grok, Claude, etc.) is **IGNORED** for `/imagine` commands

**Commands**:
- `/imagine <description>` - Generate with default provider (DALL-E 3)
- `/imagine_all <description>` - Generate with all providers (DALL-E 3, Imagen 3, Flux.1) for comparison

---

#### 2️⃣ Image ANALYSIS (Vision Models)
**Purpose**: Analyze EXISTING images with AI

**How to use**:
1. **Select a vision model** from dropdown (look for 👁️ badge):
   - Grok-3, Grok-2-Vision
   - Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude 3.5, Claude Opus
   - Gemini models
   - GPT-4o, GPT-4.1
2. **Click the paperclip** 📎 button (bottom-left of input)
3. **Upload an image** (PNG, JPG, WebP, etc.)
4. **Ask about the image**: "What do you see?" or "Describe this image"
5. The selected vision model will analyze it

**Use cases**:
- Describe photos, screenshots, diagrams
- Extract text from images (OCR)
- Analyze charts, graphs, infographics
- Identify objects, people, scenes
- Answer questions about visual content

---

**⚠️ COMMON MISTAKE**: Selecting Grok-3 and typing `/imagine` will NOT use Grok to generate the image. `/imagine` always uses DALL-E/Imagen/Flux. To use Grok's vision, **upload an image** instead!

## 🦙 Ollama Setup (Local AI Models)

RangerPlex supports running AI models **locally** on your machine using Ollama! No API keys, no cloud dependenciesjust pure local AI power.

### Why Use Ollama?
- ✅ **100% Private** - All processing stays on your machine
- ✅ **No API Costs** - Run unlimited queries for free
- ✅ **Works Offline** - No internet needed after model download
- ✅ **Powerful Models** - Run 7B to 70B parameter models (depending on your RAM)

### Quick Start

#### Step 1: Install Ollama
Download from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)

**Need installation help?** Follow this step-by-step tutorial:
📖 [How to Install Ollama - Complete Guide](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ollama)

#### Step 2: Pull a Model
Open Terminal and run:
```bash
# Recommended models:
ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b    # 9GB - Fast reasoning & coding
ollama pull qwen2.5:32b         # 20GB - Very fast, great for general use
ollama pull llama3.3:70b        # 40GB - Most capable (needs 64GB+ RAM)
ollama pull mistral:latest      # 4GB - Lightweight & fast
```

#### Step 3: Configure RangerPlex
1. Open RangerPlex Settings (⚙️ gear icon)
2. Go to **"Ollama"** tab
3. Set:
   - **Ollama Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/ollama`
   - **Ollama Model ID**: `deepseek-r1:14b` (or your chosen model name)
4. Click **"Test"** button - should show ✅
5. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 4: Chat with Local AI!
1. Create a new chat
2. Select **"Local"** model from dropdown
3. Start chatting! 💬

### Important Configuration Notes

⚠️ **Use the Proxy URL, NOT direct Ollama URL!**
- ✅ **Correct**: `http://localhost:3000/api/ollama` (proxy - works!)
- ❌ **Wrong**: `http://localhost:11434` (direct - CORS errors!)

The proxy eliminates browser CORS restrictions and enables proper streaming.

### Model Recommendations by RAM

| Your RAM | Recommended Model | Size | Speed |
|----------|-------------------|------|-------|
| 8GB | mistral:latest | 4GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ |
| 16GB | deepseek-r1:14b | 9GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ |
| 32GB | qwen2.5:32b | 20GB | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ |
| 64GB+ | llama3.3:70b | 40GB | ⚡⚡⚡ |
| 128GB+ | qwen2.5:72b | 40GB | ⚡⚡⚡ |

### Troubleshooting

**"Ollama API Error: Not Found"**
- Check Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Verify Base URL uses proxy: `http://localhost:3000/api/ollama`
- Ensure model name matches exactly (check with `ollama list`)

**"Connection Failed"**
- Make sure RangerPlex server is running: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- Verify proxy is on port 3000: `lsof -i :3000`

**Model too slow?**
- Use a smaller model (14B instead of 70B)
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Check Activity Monitor for RAM pressure

### Advanced: Network Setup (M4 + M3)

Want to run Ollama on a powerful Mac (like M4 Max) and access it from another Mac (M3)?

## 💾 Data Persistence

RangerPlex uses a **triple-layer backup system** to ensure your data is never lost:

### 1. IndexedDB (Browser)
- **Location**: Your browser's local storage
- **Capacity**: Up to 50MB+
- **Survives**: Page refreshes, browser restarts
- **Cleared by**: Browser cache clear, incognito mode

### 2. SQLite Database (Server)
- **Location**: `./data/rangerplex.db`
- **Capacity**: Unlimited
- **Survives**: Browser cache clears, browser reinstalls
- **Cleared by**: Manual deletion only

### 3. File Backups
- **Location**: `./backups/RangerPlex_Backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- **Frequency**: Auto-export every 5 minutes
- **Survives**: Everything (it's a file on your disk!)
- **Cleared by**: Manual deletion only

### 🔄 How Sync Works
1. You make a change (new chat, edit settings, upload avatar)
2. Change is saved to **IndexedDB** (instant)
3. Critical settings (Cloud Sync toggle, avatars) save immediately without requiring Save button
4. Change is sent to **Server** via WebSocket (real-time)
5. Server saves to **SQLite** database
6. Every 5 minutes, **Auto-Sync** runs (when cloud sync enabled):
   - Syncs all chats from IndexedDB to SQLite
   - Syncs all settings including avatars
   - Updates last sync timestamp
7. Every 5 minutes, server exports to **JSON file** (backup layer)

### 🗄️ Database Setup
**No installation required!** SQLite is embedded via npm package.

The database is automatically created at `./data/rangerplex.db` on first run.

**Multi-OS Support:**
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Linux

### 📦 Managing Your Data
Go to **Settings → Data & Backup** to:
- **Enable/Disable Cloud Sync**: Toggle automatic synchronization to server (auto-saves immediately)
- **Sync Now**: Manually trigger sync with beautiful progress bar showing real-time status
- **Backup & Restore Manager** (NEW): Full system backup/restore UI.
    - **Export**: Download all data (chats, settings, canvas) to JSON.
    - **Import**: Restore from backup files with Merge/Replace options.
- **View Storage Stats**: See actual storage usage in KB for browser (IndexedDB) and server (SQLite)
- **Last Sync Time**: View when data was last synchronized to server
- **Clear Browser Cache**: Remove local IndexedDB data (server data remains safe)
- **Wipe Server Database**: Delete all data from SQLite server (use with caution!)

### 🔄 System Updates
Go to **Settings → Help** to:
- **Check for Updates**: One-click check against GitHub to see if you are running the latest version.


### 🔑 API Key Configuration (.env File)
RangerPlex supports loading API keys from a `.env` file for convenience.

**Quick Setup:**
1. Copy the example file: `cp .env-example .env`
2. Open `.env` in any text editor
3. Fill in your API keys (see [Getting API Keys](#-getting-api-keys) below)
4. Restart the dev server (`npm start`)

**Location**: `.env` in the project root (git-ignored for security)

**Format** (must use `VITE_` prefix for Vite compatibility):
```bash
# Google Gemini (Free tier available)
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# OpenAI / ChatGPT (Paid only)
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Anthropic Claude (Free tier available)
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Perplexity AI (Paid only)
VITE_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here

# xAI Grok (Paid only - NO FREE TIER - Add credits first!)
VITE_GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key_here

# Hugging Face (Free tier available)
VITE_HUGGINGFACE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here

# Brave Search (Free tier available)
VITE_BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key_here

# ElevenLabs (Text-to-Speech - Free tier: 10,000 chars/month)
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

**How it works:**
- Keys in `.env` are loaded as **defaults** (not saved to database)
- Keys entered in **Settings** override `.env` values
- The `.env-example` file includes comprehensive documentation with:
  - Links to get each API key
  - Free tier vs paid service information
  - Vite-specific configuration notes
  - Security best practices

**Important Notes:**
- **Vite Requirement**: All environment variables exposed to the client must start with `VITE_`
- **Access in code**: `import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Priority**: Settings > .env > Empty (keys in Settings override .env)
- **Security**: Never commit your `.env` file (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **Grok/xAI**: Requires purchasing credits first (NO FREE TIER)

### 🦙 Ollama (Local AI - Optional)

**Ollama** enables privacy-first local AI models that run entirely on your machine. No API keys, no internet required, and your data never leaves your computer.

**Why Use Ollama?**
- 🔒 **100% Private** - All processing happens on your machine
- 💸 **Zero Cost** - No API fees, unlimited usage
- ⚡ **Offline Capable** - Works without internet
- 🎯 **Fast** - No network latency for responses
- 🧠 **Powerful Models** - Llama 3.3, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more

**Installation:**

#### macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon: M1, M2, M3, M4)
1. Go to **[ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)**
2. Download the **.dmg** installer
3. Drag Ollama to Applications folder
4. Launch Ollama (menu bar icon will appear)
5. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora)
```bash
# One-line install
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama with CORS enabled
OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve
```

#### Windows
1. Go to **[ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)**
2. Download the Windows installer
3. Run the installer
4. Open PowerShell and set environment variable:
   ```powershell
   $env:OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
   ollama serve
   ```

**Pulling Models:**
After installing Ollama, download models you want to use:
```bash
# Fast & efficient (recommended for most users)
ollama pull llama3.3:70b

# Coding specialist
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b

# Fast local model
ollama pull mistral

# See all available models: https://ollama.com/library
```

**Using Ollama in RangerPlex:**
1. Make sure Ollama is running with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"` set
2. In RangerPlex Settings → **Providers** tab
3. Set **Ollama URL** to `http://localhost:11434` (default)
4. Select your pulled model from the dropdown
5. Start chatting! Your data stays 100% local

**Troubleshooting:**
- **"Ollama isn't connecting"**: Make sure you started Ollama with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"` environment variable
- **"Model not found"**: Pull the model first using `ollama pull <model-name>`
- **Slow responses**: Larger models (70B+) need powerful hardware; try smaller models like `mistral` or `llama3.3:8b`

**Note**: All API keys are stored **locally** in your browser and server database. They are never sent to us or any third party (except the respective AI providers when you make requests).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1.  Click the **Gear Icon** in the top right.
2.  **Providers Tab**: Enter your API Keys (see [Getting API Keys](#-getting-api-keys) above).
    *   *Note: API Keys are stored locally in your browser. They are never sent to us.*
3.  **Test Connection**: Click the "Test" button next to each API key to verify it works.
4.  **Proxy Check**: Ensure the "Proxy URL" is set to `http://localhost:3000` and click "Test". It should turn Green.

### 🚀 One-Command Install

You can set up everything with a single command:
```bash
bash install-me-now.sh
```
The installer will:
- Detect your OS and package manager (macOS/Linux/WSL)
- Ensure Node.js v22 via nvm (recommended) and install npm deps (`npm ci`)
- Guide you through API key entry (Brave, OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, etc.) and write them to `.env`
- Show clear next steps to start the app

### ▶️ How to Start (Two Ways)

**Option 1 (RECOMMENDED):** Start everything with one command:
```bash
npm start
```
Runs BOTH servers (proxy + Vite) together. This is the correct command that starts everything you need.

**Option 2 (manual, if you prefer two terminals):**
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run server

# Terminal 2
npm run dev
```
Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

### 🧹 Uninstall
Clean up local artifacts without touching your repo:
```bash
bash uninstall-me-now.sh
```
You’ll be prompted before removing things like `node_modules`, `.env`, caches, or local data/backups.

### 🎵 Ranger Radio in Screensaver
While the screensaver is up, there’s a “Ranger Radio” button in the control bar to play/pause the floating radio player without leaving screensaver mode.

### 🪪 Registration Options (Concept)
We’re planning a lightweight registration flow (collect email, issue a code, show a “Registered” sticker). See `docs/registration_options.md` for approaches:
- Option A: In-app code (no email service)
- Option B: SMTP (nodemailer)
- Option C: Email API (SendGrid/Mailgun/SES/Postmark)
- Option D: Deferred/manual send
Pros/cons and data/UX notes are in that doc.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "I see a Black Screen!"
*   **Cause**: You might be opening the `index.html` file directly or using an old server.
*   **Fix**: Ensure you are using `npm run dev` to start the app. The app requires **Vite** to compile the TypeScript code.

### "Anthropic/Claude isn't working"
*   **Cause**: The Proxy Server isn't running.
*   **Fix**: Check **Terminal 1**. Ensure `node proxy_server.js` is running. In Settings, verify Proxy URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

### "Ollama isn't connecting"
*   **Cause**: Cross-Origin restrictions or Ollama not running.
*   **Fix**:
    1. Make sure Ollama is installed (see [Ollama Installation](#-ollama-local-ai---optional) above)
    2. Start Ollama with CORS enabled:
       - **Mac/Linux:** `OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*" ollama serve`
       - **Windows PowerShell:** `$env:OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"; ollama serve`
    3. Verify Ollama is running: `curl http://localhost:11434` (should respond)
    4. Check Ollama URL in Settings → Providers is set to `http://localhost:11434`

### "Grok/xAI says 'Incorrect API key' (HTTP 400)"
*   **Cause**: The API key you entered is invalid or incorrect.
*   **Error**: `"Incorrect API key provided: xx***xx. You can obtain an API key from https://console.x.ai"`
*   **Fix**:
    1. Go to **[console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)** (official xAI console)
    2. Sign in with your X/Twitter account
    3. Navigate to **API Keys** section (left sidebar)
    4. Click **"Create API Key"** (keys are shown only once when created)
    5. Copy the **entire key** (starts with `xai-`)
    6. Paste into RangerPlex Settings → Providers → **Grok API Key**
    7. Click **Save**
*   **Common mistakes**:
    - Copying only part of the key (keys are long!)
    - Extra spaces before/after the key
    - Using an old/expired key (keys expire after 90 days)
*   **Test your key**: Run `bash test-grok-api.sh` from project root

### "Grok/xAI says 'no credits' (HTTP 403)"
*   **Cause**: Your API key is valid, but your xAI account doesn't have credits yet.
*   **Error**: `"Your newly created teams doesn't have any credits yet"`
*   **Fix**:
    1. Go to **[console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)**
    2. Click your team name (top right) → **Billing** or **Credits**
    3. Add a payment method
    4. Purchase credits (start with $5-$10 for testing)
    5. xAI uses pay-as-you-go pricing (~$0.50-$5 per 1M tokens depending on model)
*   **Test your key**: Run `bash test-grok-api.sh` from project root
*   **Note**: Unlike some APIs, xAI has **no free tier** - you must add credits to use the API

### "better-sqlite3 won't compile"
*   **Cause**: Using Node.js v25 (too new, experimental) or incompatible version.
*   **Fix**: Use Node.js v22 LTS (recommended, long-term support):
    ```bash
    # Option A: Using Homebrew (Mac)
    brew install node@22
    brew unlink node
    brew link --force node@22

    # Option B: Using nvm (Mac/Linux)
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    nvm install 22
    nvm use 22

    # Reinstall dependencies
    cd path/to/RangerPlex
    npm install
    ```
    **Note**: Node v20 is deprecated (Oct 2026), v25 is not supported.

### "API keys disappeared after update"
*   **Cause**: Migration from localStorage to IndexedDB.
*   **Fix**: Your keys are safe! Either:
    - Re-enter them in Settings (they'll be saved to IndexedDB + Server)
    - Or add them to `.env` file (they'll auto-load as defaults)

### "LM Studio says 'invalid model ID'"
*   **Cause**: Models with "gpt" in their name (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-20b`) were being routed to OpenAI instead of LM Studio.
*   **Fix**: Update to v2.5.27 or later. The routing logic now checks LM Studio models before checking for "gpt" in the model name.
*   **Workaround** (older versions): Use models without "gpt" in their name.

### "Port 3000 already in use (EADDRINUSE)"
*   **Cause**: A previous instance of the proxy server is still running.
*   **Fix**:
    ```bash
    # Kill the process using port 3000
    lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
    # Then restart
    npm start
    ```

### "better-sqlite3 version mismatch (NODE_MODULE_VERSION)"
*   **Cause**: The native module was compiled for a different Node.js version.
*   **Error**: `was compiled against NODE_MODULE_VERSION 141. This version requires 127`
*   **Fix**:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules/better-sqlite3
    npm install better-sqlite3
    ```

### "Ollama says 'Not Found'"
*   **Cause**: The configured model doesn't exist in Ollama.
*   **Fix**:
    1. Go to Settings → Ollama tab
    2. Click the **Refresh** button to fetch available models
    3. Select an installed model from the dropdown
    4. If empty, pull a model first: `ollama pull llama3`

2. Saved to **IndexedDB** (instant, browser)
3. Critical settings auto-save immediately (Cloud Sync toggle, avatars)
4. Sent to **Server** via WebSocket (real-time)
5. Server saves to **SQLite** database (persistent)
6. Every 5 minutes, **Auto-Sync** verifies all data is synchronized (chats, settings, avatars)
7. Every 5 minutes, server exports to **JSON file** (backup layer)

## 🛠️ A Personal Note: The "Student's Dilemma"

I built RangerPlex in about **50 hours**—including a 24-hour coding marathon fueled by hyperfocus. According to an analysis by **Gemini 1.5 Pro**, a project with this feature set (Radio, Pet, Study Clock, 7+ AI Models, Database, Sync) would typically take a traditional software team **~500+ hours** to build.

**Why did I build it?**
I'm a student with **Dyslexia, ADHD, and Autism**.
*   **The Irony**: I probably spent more time building this app *to help me study* than actually studying! (Classic college life, right? Anything to avoid the books! 😂)
*   **The Challenge**: My biggest struggle is memory. I can't hold everything in my head at once.
*   **The Solution**: I built RangerPlex to be my external brain. It remembers my chats, my settings, and my study sessions so I don't have to. As long as I put a thought into a note and save it—**problem solved!**

**My Realization:**
You don't need to be a master programmer to build something complex. You just need a clear **vision** and the ability to **communicate** that vision to AI. It's not about knowing every language backwards; it's about asking the right questions and working things out together.

**Is it perfect?** Definitely not! I'd rate it about **83%**.
I'm still learning. I introduced complex memory systems halfway through, which definitely caused some chaos! If I had a staff of 10 at Microsoft or Google, maybe it would be flawless. But for one person learning as they go? It shows what's possible.

**The Goal:**
I hope this proves that the barrier to building your ideas is lower than ever. You don't need to be an expert to start—you just need to be curious, persistent, and maybe a little bit stubborn.

*"If I can drive the software, I don't need to drive F1."*
