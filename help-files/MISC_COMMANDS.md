## 🎪 The Philosophy

> *"If it happens in reality, why not with my computer?"*
>
> — David Keane, RangerPlex Creator

RangerPlex isn't just a tool—it's a **companion**, a **command center**, and a **creative playground**. We believe software should be:

- **Helpful**: Solve real problems
- **Joyful**: Spark delight
- **Personal**: Adapt to you
- **Powerful**: No limits

That's why we have both `/nmap` for serious security work AND `/chuck` for laughter. Both matter!
